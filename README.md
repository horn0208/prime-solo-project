# Project Name
Wet Rock Dry Rock - Climbing Conditions App

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

For rock climbers, it can be hard to figure out whether the rock in an area is likely to be dry and safe to climb without driving there, often several hours away, to check. Even worse, sometimes unknown factors can ruin the day when you arrive unprepared, like breaking trail through waist-deep snow, a sudden hatch of biting flies, or finding that falcons are nesting on the route you planned to climb.

WRDR gives climbers an easy way to check weather conditions and recent rainfall where they hope to climb, as well as a place to share and view other climbers' recent experiences so there are fewer unknowns before committing to that long drive.

WRDR is a full-stack app built with React and Redux-Saga which allows logged-in users to view a list of climbing areas. An area details view displays more information, including the point forecast for that area, and comments from all users regarding that area. A user may add new comments, and can also edit and delete their own comments.
